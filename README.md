# Maintaining Relationships During Covid-19
Amidst the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, face-to-face interactions are no longer the norm, leaving friends and family unsure of how to maintain their relationships. Introducing the IHeardThereWasFreeShirts Telegram Bot, a bot that helps to recreate the experience of dining together with your friends and loved ones in an online setting, Food Santa style (think Secret Santa, but for food!).

The bot helps to schedule virtual meals with your friend groups, in which each friend of the group would treat one other friend of the group to a meal. Friends can then enjoy their meals together over Zoom.

## How the Bot Works
- Add the @iheardtherewasfreeshirtsbot into your telegram group
- Any member of the group can start a new Foodsession, and members of the group can opt in to join the session
- Session begins!
- Session participants can vote for their preferred price range for the FoodSanta session. The option with the highest votes will be used.
- Session participants would enter their address into the bot privately.
- Following which, after all participants have filled their addresses, the bot would automatically assign each participant with another friend to send a food delivery over to. Each participant will receive a private message from the bot stating the name and address of their assigned friend to send a meal to.
