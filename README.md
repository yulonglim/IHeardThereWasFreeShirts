# Eating with Friends During Covid-19
In a post-Covid world where face-to-face interactions is no longer the main mode of communication, we propose the maintaining of relationships through the IHeardThereWasFreeShirts Telegram bot. The bot helps to schedule virtual meals with your friends, where each friend of the group would treat one other friend of the group to a meal. Participants will then have their meals together over Zoom.

## How the Bot Works
Once added into a Telegram group, any member of the group can start a session, and members of the group can choose to join the session if they wish.
After session participants are finalised, the bot would automatically assign each participant with a mortal to send food deliveries over to.
